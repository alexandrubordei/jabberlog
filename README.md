# jabberlog

Logs the interaction times within a Google hangouts (GTalk) conversation. It creates a CSV with the interactions. 
It logs with the credentials of one of the users engaged in a conversation and receives notifications when a new message is sent. The actual message is not logged, only interaction times.

Google does not send the messages to all participants to a chat as somehow the jabber protocol is not fully supported anymore.

It was initially designed as a way of tracking engagement between two individuals.
